Data analysis projects with R

Welcome to the Data Analysis Small Projects with R repository! This repository contains a collection of small data analysis projects that use publicly available datasets on topics such as mental health, gender media exposure, home prices, and movie ratings. The analysis techniques used in these projects include Bayesian statistics, inferential statistics, and linear regression.

The projects are designed as part of the Coursera course "Statistics with R". Each project contains a brief introduction to the topic, a description of the data source and variables, and a detailed explanation of the analysis methods used. The R code used for the analysis is also provided, along with explanations and interpretations of the results.

Each project is contained in a separate folder and can be run independently. The datasets used in each project are included in the project folder and are also publicly available for download.

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us.
